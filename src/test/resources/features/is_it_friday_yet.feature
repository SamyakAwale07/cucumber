Pretty much: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  @Lo @AIO-FOLDER-CASESWITHSPACES/AND/LOGIN/INSIDE
  Awww, look mate: Today is or is not Friday
    Y'know today is "<day>"
    It's just unbelievable I ask whether it's Friday yet
    But at the end of the day I reckon I should be told "<answer>"

    You'll wanna:
      | day            | answer |
      | Friday         | TGIF   |
      | Sunday         | Nope   |
      | anything else! | Nope   |
